# twitch-kraken

The twitch-kraken module is designed to easily access the Twitch(.tv) API, which is documented [here](https://github.com/justintv/twitch-api).

## Overview

The goal is to heavily document and test the module, making it robust and very easy to use.

## Contributing

twitch-kraken is still in an early development phase, but everyone is free to fork it and make pull requests.
